# Tx Pause value passed from AXI-Lite domain into the MAC Tx - pause_req / pause_value
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This is very standard bus crossings methodology.  When the bus is updated (clk_a2b_bus_reg[*]) in
# its source clock domain, a single bit is toggled (ClkASignalToggle_reg); this single bit is
# passed across the clock domain and its change of state is detected in the new clock domain.  When
# this occurs, the bus, held stable on the source clock domain, can be sampled in the new clock
# domain safely.  The rules for this are:
#   * We are not concerned with how long it takes for the toggle bit to cross the clock domain so
#     it is false_path -ed
#   * However, we NEED the bus to be stable when sampled, so we need to use a max_delay on all bits
#     so we know that all bits of the bus have arrived at the destination sampling flip-flops when
#     sampled.  The minimum route delay for the toggle signal is here assumed to be 0 ns for the
#     CDC route, then we have 5 synchronisation flip-flops in the new clock domain before
#     combinatorial toggle detection is performed (requiring one further clock period).  The first
#     of these 5 sync flip-flops could be transparant (change to new logic state immediately), so we
#     have 4 clock periods remaining for the synchroniser, plus one for the toggle detection = 5
#     clock periods. So maximum route delay (worst case) can be 5 x 8 ns = 40 ns (minus the setup
#     requirement of the sampling flip-flop) for the circuit to guarantee that it will work. Here I
#     used 32 ns to provide more than enough margin (8ns) for the flip-flop setup requirement.
#
#     So all bits of clk_a2b_bus_reg[*] will be routed in < 32 ns and the circuit will be reliable.
#     Were this unconstrainted, and if the router sent just one of these bits around the FPGA and
#     its unconstrainted route was greated than approximately 40 ns, this circuit could sample an
#     incorrect value.

# Standard bus crossings methodology again (see above comments for Tx Pause).  Again the control

# The following constraints are for gray coded busses.  Gray codes work by having only a single bit
# that changes per clock cycle: therefore all but 1 bit should be stable for sample at any time on
# the new clock domain. The single bit causes some uncertainty but only by 1 (equivalent binary
# value) - so we may sample either the very latest value, or at worst case, the previous value.

# However, we have to ensure that the route delay for all bits is < 1 clock period; if there were
# no max_delay constraints on this bus, it is possible that 1 single bit of this bus could be
# routed round the FPGA and have a routing delay > 1 clock period.  If this were the case, then
# this bit, arriving late, could coincide with the next bit changing; on the sample side, 2 bits
# could have changed at once giving 2 bits of uncertainty and the equivalent binary value is
# no-longer reliable.  Adding the max_delay constraint here to be < 1 clock period will ensure that
# this gray code crossing is reliable.
